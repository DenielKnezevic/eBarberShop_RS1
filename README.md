In the collaborative development of the web app, my primary responsibility focused on creating the admin panel using Angular. Specifically, my contributions include:

- Admin Panel: I developed an intuitive and user-friendly admin panel that allows efficient management of key aspects of the barbershop business.

- Employee Management: Within the admin panel, I implemented a feature to add and manage employees, enabling the barbershop to easily keep track of its staff members.

- Product Management: I integrated a functionality to add and manage products within the admin panel. This enables the barbershop to update and showcase their offerings effectively.

- Location Management: I incorporated a location management feature, allowing the admin to add and maintain various barbershop locations.

- Service Management: I implemented a service management feature that enables the admin to add and update the services provided by the barbershop. This ensures that customers are well-informed about the available services.

- SignalR Chart: As part of my contribution, I developed a SignalR service that provides a dynamic chart. This chart displays the count of objects such as employees, products, locations, and services, allowing the admin to have a real-time overview of the barbershop's offerings.

- Product Page: I designed and implemented a page where customers can view the available products. The page includes multiple search options to enhance the user experience and make it easier for customers to find their desired products.

- Services Page: I created a dedicated page that showcases the various services provided by the barbershop. This page provides essential information for customers, helping them make informed decisions.

With my contributions to the admin panel, dynamic chart, product page, and services page, I aimed to enhance the usability and functionality of the web app, ultimately contributing to a seamless experience for both administrators and customers.
